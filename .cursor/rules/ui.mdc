# UI Implementation Rules

When implementing UI in this project:

- **Implement, don't design.** Build what's specified; don't invent new layouts or visual treatments.
- **Use shadcn/ui components and Tailwind only.** No custom component libraries or one-off styled divs where a shadcn component exists.
- **Follow existing design tokens.** Use theme variables already in `app/globals.css` (colors, radius, etc.). Do not add new tokens.
- **Prefer simple, dense, boring UI.** Minimal decoration, compact layouts.
- **No new colors, gradients, or animations.** Stick to the existing palette; avoid gradients and decorative motion.
- **Accessibility first.** Semantic HTML, visible focus states, ARIA where needed, keyboard and screen-reader friendly.
- **Ask before introducing new variants.** Do not add new Button/Card/input variants or similar without explicit approval.
